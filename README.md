# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Onboarding Scripts

These onboarding scripts help you quickly run a proof of concept (POC) for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) on Ubuntu and RHEL-based systems. They are designed to streamline the onboarding process, making it easier to test MDE on 5 to 10 virtual machines without having to copy and paste commands line by line.

## Why Use These Scripts?

Running a POC can be time-consuming and error-prone when you have to copy and paste commands manually. These scripts simplify the process, allowing you to experience the MDE service firsthand and validate its requirements on a small number of VMs.

Please note that while these scripts are perfect for small-scale testing, you should consider using configuration management tools like Puppet, Chef, Ansible, or your preferred alternative for large-scale deployments or production environments. These tools help automate the deployment and configuration processes, ensuring consistency and efficiency across all devices.
